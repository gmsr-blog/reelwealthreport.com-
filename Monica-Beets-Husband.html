            <p>Monica Beets is a total badass on the TV show <em>Gold Rush</em>. She’s got this fierce vibe and serious skills when it comes to gold mining. But let’s be real—fans are just as curious about her life off the mines, especially who she’s married to. Spoiler alert: Monica’s hitched to Taylor Mayes, a guy who’s just as into mining as she is. They connected over their love for the gritty world of digging for gold, and that shared passion turned into something special.</p>

            <h2>A Yukon Love Story</h2>
            <p>Monica and Taylor tied the knot on August 11, 2018, in Dawson City, Yukon. Their wedding was straight-up gorgeous, and lucky for fans, it was featured in a special <em>Gold Rush</em> episode. Picture this: Monica rocking a stunning backless gown, Taylor looking dapper in a black suit, and the wild Yukon scenery all around them. It was a small, heartfelt ceremony with just family and close friends, but the love between them was impossible to miss. Fans ate it up, seeing their fave miner glow with happiness.</p>

            <h2>Who Is Taylor Mayes?</h2>
            <p>Taylor Mayes is a pro when it comes to heavy equipment. Like Monica, he’s deep in the mining game, working hard to keep things running smoothly. He’s not a big TV guy, so you won’t see him much on <em>Gold Rush</em>. But behind the scenes? He’s a rock star. Monica’s dad, Tony Beets, is a huge fan of Taylor’s work ethic. He’s out there operating the big machines that make the Beets family’s mining business hum. Quiet but essential—that’s Taylor’s vibe.</p>

            <h2>Building a Family</h2>
            <p>In 2019, Monica and Taylor welcomed their daughter, Jasmine, and let me tell you, she’s adorable. Monica shared the news on <em>Gold Rush</em> and her Instagram, and fans couldn’t get enough. Jasmine’s popped up on the show a few times, stealing hearts with her cuteness. Monica and Taylor are pretty private about their family life, but they’ll occasionally post sweet moments online. Raising Jasmine in the Yukon is a big part of their world, and they’re loving every second of it.</p>

            <h2>A Rock-Solid Marriage</h2>
            <p>What makes Monica and Taylor’s relationship so strong? They’re on the same wavelength. Both of them are all about the outdoors, tackling the tough mining life, and supporting each other. They’re partners in work and parenting, which keeps their bond tight. Some fans got worried when Taylor didn’t show up much on Monica’s social media, sparking rumors they’d split. But nah, those are just rumors. They’re still going strong, just keeping their love low-key and out of the spotlight.</p>

            <h2>Monica’s Rise to Fame</h2>
            <p>Monica’s not just a miner—she’s a legit reality TV star with a huge following. Her net worth’s around $1.5 million, thanks to <em>Gold Rush</em> and her mining hustle. She started working with her dad at 12, learning how to run heavy machines. By 18, she was bossing it as a supervisor, leading crews of guys way older than her. Her grit and confidence make her a role model, especially for young women watching the show.</p>

            <h2>Life in the Yukon</h2>
            <p>Monica and Taylor call Dawson City home, living in a house they built together. It’s the perfect spot, surrounded by the Yukon’s rugged beauty. They work hard in the mines but make time for the simple stuff—hanging with Jasmine and their dog, Doyle. Fans love Monica for juggling her career, marriage, and mom life like a pro.</p>

            <h2>Why We Love Their Story</h2>
            <p>Monica and Taylor’s love story is proof that you can find something real in the toughest places. Their shared dreams and mutual respect keep them solid. Fans are always hoping to see more of Taylor on <em>Gold Rush</em>, but for now, he’s cool being Monica’s biggest supporter off-camera. Together, they’re a powerhouse team, showing that hard work and love can build an awesome life.</p>
