            <h2>Latest 2025 Updates</h2>
            <p>Chicago PD is a thrilling TV show that follows the cops of the Chicago Police Department’s Intelligence Unit. One character, Dante Torres, has fans buzzing with questions: “Is Dante Torres leaving Chicago PD?” Played by Benjamin Levy Aguilar, Torres is a rookie officer with a tough past. Let’s explore the latest 2025 updates to find out what’s going on with him.</p>

            <h2>Torres’ Background and Role</h2>
            <p>Torres joined Chicago PD in Season 9 and became a regular in Season 10. His story is intense because he used to be in a gang as a teen. Now, as a cop, he fights to do good, but his past keeps haunting him. In Season 12, aired in 2025, Torres has been through a lot, making fans worry he might leave the show.</p>

            <h2>Recent Absence Sparks Rumors</h2>
            <p>Recently, Torres was missing from two episodes of Season 12, Episodes 16 and 17. This made viewers nervous. In Episode 17, “Transference,” aired on April 2, 2025, Kim Burgess and Kiana Cook talked about Torres taking a few days off. They didn’t know why, which seemed suspicious. This absence sparked rumors that Torres might be written out of the show.</p>

            <h2>Torres’ Return in “Demons”</h2>
            <p>However, Torres returned in Episode 18, “Demons,” aired on April 16, 2025. He was clearly struggling. He told Sergeant Hank Voight he couldn’t sleep and was boxing to exhaust himself, but it wasn’t helping. Voight suggested he take time off, showing concern. This episode proved Torres is still part of the Intelligence Unit, calming some fan fears.</p>

            <h2>Loyalty Under Pressure</h2>
            <p>In “Demons,” a new character, Deputy Chief Reid, tried to use Torres against Voight. Reid sensed Torres was weak and pushed him to spy on his team. But Torres stayed loyal and told Voight everything. This choice showed his strength, even when he was feeling lost. It also hinted that Torres’ story is far from over.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Gloria Perez’s Death</h2>
            <p>Another big part of Torres’ life is his secret romance with Gloria Perez, a former informant. In Season 12, Episode 8, “Penance,” aired in November 2024, Gloria died protecting Torres. This broke his heart, and he felt guilty. His team, including Voight and Ruzek, supported him, forgiving his mistakes. This moment showed Torres isn’t leaving, as the show keeps building his emotional journey.</p>

            <h2>Torres’ Fan Appeal</h2>
            <p>Torres’ past makes him a fan favorite. He’s been through trauma, like growing up in a gang and protecting his mom from abuse. In Episode 12, “The Good Shepherd,” he went undercover in a juvenile detention center where he was once held as a teen. This brought back painful memories, but he helped abused kids, showing his heart. Fans love how he fights to be better despite his struggles.</p>

            <h2>Fan Reactions on X</h2>
            <p>Some fans on X have shared their thoughts. One post said Voight might suspect something “fishy” with Torres, while another mentioned Voight wanting to help him. These posts show viewers are invested in Torres’ story, but they don’t confirm he’s leaving. Instead, they suggest more drama is coming.</p>

            <h2>Benjamin Levy Aguilar’s Commitment</h2>
            <p>There’s no official news from NBC or Benjamin Levy Aguilar about Torres exiting. Aguilar has even talked about loving his role. In a 2023 interview, he said he hopes for happier moments for Torres, hinting he’s committed to the show. His Instagram posts before Season 11 also confirmed he’s staying, easing fan worries.</p>

            <h2>Chicago PD’s Storytelling Style</h2>
            <p>Chicago PD loves keeping fans guessing. Characters often take breaks but return, like when Torres was absent in Season 10’s finale to care for his sick mom. The show’s writers seem to be setting up more for Torres, especially with his battles against Reid and his personal demons.</p>

            <h2>Is Torres Staying?</h2>
            <p>So, is Dante Torres leaving Chicago PD? As of April 2025, it looks like he’s staying. His return in “Demons” and ongoing storylines show he’s still a key part of the team. But with Chicago PD’s surprises, anything can happen. Keep watching new episodes on NBC Wednesdays at 10/9c or stream on Peacock to see what’s next for Torres!</p>
